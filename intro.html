      <p> <span class="title ">What is Bootstrap? Why Would I Use It ? <br></span><br>

        Bootstrap 4 is the latest version of the widely popular front-end framework, Bootstrap.
        Bootstrap 4 has a lot of new exciting features and capabilities that make building responsive designs even
        easier
        than before. The biggest add-on is that it is heavily built on Flexbox.</p> <br> <br>
      <br>
      <p> <span class="title "> Should I Still Learn Bootstrap in 2020 ? <br></span><br>
        Years ago, the main reason I learned Bootstrap was the ease of building responsive designs. However, before the
        release of the new version of Bootstrap, I stopped using the framework. Why?
        With the advent of Flexbox and CSS Grid, I found it easier to build responsive modules using native CSS support.
        Among experienced developers, my guess is that Bootstrap is less popular. This is a personal opinion, not a
        verified fact. But, whether you’re an old hand, or new to the world of responsive designs, there are still good
        reasons to learn Bootstrap:
        <div class="ndtxt"> <br>
          <span class="ndtitle"> 1. Fast Prototyping <br></span> <br>
          There are lots of other tools and frameworks that make prototyping fast. For instance, you may have heard of
          Bulma and Materialize.
          Bootstrap is an equal contender here. Many would argue they do not need some of the other features of the
          framework. Yet, Bootstrap allows you to customize and pick what modules are relevant to you. <br>
          <br><span class="ndtitle"> 2. Responsive Web Design <br> </span> <br>
          For beginners, responsive web design is a big deal. It’s easy to laugh it off when you’re an experienced
          developer, but think back to when you started. That sh*t was hard to pull off. Bootstrap makes it relatively
          easy. <br>
          <br><span class="ndtitle"> 3. Old Codebase <br> </span> <br>
          When I stopped using Bootstrap for personal and new projects, I still had to refactor and maintain an old
          codebase at work. Whether you like it or not, a lot of older codebases are written in Bootstrap. You don’t
          want to look clueless just because you are “pro” and don’t like Bootstrap. <br>
          <br><span class="ndtitle"> 4. The Latest Version is Smarter and Better <br> </span> <br>
          The new Bootstrap version 4 is a lot smarter. It is built on top of Flexbox, and comes with a lot of savor we
          will explore in later sections of this article. <br>
          <br><span class="ndtitle"> 5. Greater Ease of Customization <br> </span> <br>
          The new Bootstrap 4 is a lot easier to customize.
          I hated Bootstrap because you had to use Less or Sass for any meaningful customization. While that is still
          partly true, version 4 is a lot more customizable than the previous versions. <br> <br> <br>

      <div class="non"><span class="title "> A Quick Note on Bootstrap 4 <br></span>
        Bootstrap 4 is the latest version of the widely popular front-end framework, Bootstrap.
        Bootstrap 4 has a lot of new exciting features and capabilities that make building responsive designs even
        easier
        than before. The biggest add-on is that it is heavily built on Flexbox.</div>
      <br> <br> <br>
      <p> <span class="title "> What is new in Bootstrap version 4 ? <br></span><br>
        This section is targeted towards more experienced developers. If you’re new to the front-end space, skip this
        and come back after reading the other sections of the article.
        The latest version of Bootstrap, version 4, is packed with a few vital changes : <br> <br>
        <div class="ndtxt"> <span class="ndtitle"> 1. The default border-box value has been changed :<br></span><br>
          Earlier versions of the bootstrap framework set the border-box value to content-box. Most people like myself
          found this annoying most of the time.
          Now the Bootstrap team has switched the value to border-box. I find this is easier to understand. <br> <br>
          <span class="ndtitle"> 2. Opinionated CSS Resets :<br></span> <br>
          CSS Resets have come a long way. In this version of Bootstrap, the CSS Reset stylesheet is called Reboot.
          Reboot does a few things differently. It is based on Normalize. It avoids margin-top , embraces the CSS
          inherit value, uses the rem unit heavily, and embraces the use of native font stack for optimum text
          rendering.
          I advise you to take 10 minutes to read about Reboot from the official docs. It’s quite a good read.

        <br> <br>

        <p> <br><span class="title "> BootstrapCDN : <br></span><br>
          When you only need to include Bootstrap’s compiled CSS or JS, you can use BootstrapCDN. <br>
          See it in action with our simple starter template, or browse the examples to jumpstart your next project.

        </div> <br> <br>
        <div class="non">Then, the optional Bootstrap Javascript is added to a &lt;scrip &gt; tag before the closing
          &lt;/body &gt; tag. Bootstrap 4 also requires jQuery and Popper.js which need to be included before the
          Bootstrap JS.
